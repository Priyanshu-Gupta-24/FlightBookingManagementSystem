# Flight Booking Management System

## Project Overview

This Flight Booking Management System is a comprehensive SQL-based database project that simulates the core functionalities of an airline reservation system. It manages Airlines, Airports, Flights, Passengers, Bookings, and Payments. The project demonstrates database schema design, complex queries, and relational data management using MySQL.

## Features

*   Airline management with contact details
    
*   Airport data management including codes and locations
    
*   Flight scheduling and seat availability tracking
    
*   Passenger information with passport and contact details
    
*   Booking records with travel class and payment status
    
*   Payment tracking with multiple methods and statuses
    
*   Advanced SQL queries for data retrieval, aggregation, and analysis
    

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

*   MySQL Server installed (version 5.7+ recommended)
    
*   MySQL Workbench or any SQL client for script execution
    

## Installation and Setup

1.  Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
    
2.  Open your MySQL client and execute the scripts in the following order:
    
    *   `ddl.sql` — to create database schema and tables
        
    *   `sample_data.sql` — to insert sample data into the tables
        
    *   `queries.sql` — to access a collection of advanced SQL queries for various operations
        
3.  Optionally, refer to the `BT23CSE187_Project_Screenshots.pdf` for screenshots and testing validation.
    

## Running Queries

You can run all queries from `queries.sql` consecutively or selectively according to your analysis needs.
